## How It Works

1. **Food Logging**:  
   Users can search or manually input meals/snacks. Each entry includes:

    - Calories
    - Macronutrients (Protein, Carbs, Fats)
    - Serving size and quantity

2. **Daily Summary**:  
   The dashboard provides a live overview of:

    - Total calories consumed vs. daily goal
    - Macronutrient distribution
    - Remaining intake limits

3. **Fitness Goal Setup**:  
   Users choose a goal (e.g., lose weight, build muscle) and the app adjusts recommended daily intakes accordingly.

4. **Progress Tracking**:  
   Visual progress charts track:

    - Daily and weekly calorie/macronutrient trends
    - Weight or body measurements (optional)

5. **Food Database**:  
   Includes a growing list of common foods and branded products. Users can also save custom meals.
